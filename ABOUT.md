# About GlobalShop

## Our Story

GlobalShop is a global e-commerce platform born from over two decades of retail and distribution expertise. Our parent company, **C&A Marketing Inc**, was founded in 2003 in Edison, New Jersey, and has since grown into a trusted name in consumer products distribution across North America.

What started as a marketing and distribution company serving major retailers has evolved into a full-fledged cross-border e-commerce operation. In 2023, we launched GlobalShop to bring our supply chain capabilities directly to consumers and independent sellers worldwide.
